## CSC2001F

### Data Structures 1:

Analysis of Algorithms: We will discuss how to express the running times of algorithms in a way that enables us to distinguish an
efficient algorithm from an inefficient one. Trees (general, binary, AVL): We will study tree data structures, their applications,
their algorithms and various techniques for ensuring their efficiency. We will end by studying Hash Tables in order to learn how
to store large amounts of data in ways that are relatively easy to index and search.

### Data Structures 2:

Searching must sometimes be done in terms of priority. Priority queues ensure that the information is always ordered so that the
information with the highest priority is easily accessible. This is a good thing because retrieval can occur in constant time. Priority
queues, and also B-tree indexes, will be studied. On a final note, we will discuss some graph algorithms because indexing and
searching operations typically do not occur independently but rather as a sequence. It is therefore important to find ways of doing
so optimally. For each of the data structures, we will discuss their pros and cons, as well as application examples for which each
one is best suited.
Databases:
This module aims to develop an understanding of what makes a good database and an awareness of the issues in database
management. On completion of the module students should be able to design, create, populate and query a database.

## CSC3002F

### Networks

Starting with the application layer network
configurations and popular tools, the focus will be on the TCP/IP suite’s transport, network, and
data link layers.

### Operating Systems

This is an introduction to the structure and organisation of operating systems. Major topics
include storage management (paging/segmentation, virtual memory, file systems) and protection
and security issues.

## CSC3003S

### Advanced Software Design 1 and 2

This part of the course is about software design, that is, how to turn ideas into quality effective and
efficient code in a systematic and controlled manner. We start by reviewing O-O & UML, project
management and software development methodologies. We investigate software development with
SCRUM. Software architecture is an important topic together with design patterns.
Theory of Algorithms
Algorithms are central to computing. This course describes how algorithms are categorised. We learn
interesting algorithms in each category and analyse their complexity.

### Theory of Computation

This part of the course focuses on the question: What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of
computers? We study this question by considering the central areas of the theory of computation:
automata, computability, and complexity.

## EEE2050F

The purpose of this course is to introduce second year students to a wide range of digital system concepts with a specific focus on
embedded systems.
This course aims to give students a strong foundation in embedded systems by introducing them to digital system fundamentals,
including: information representation, Boolean algebra, logic gate behaviour, combinational and sequential digital circuits, digital
building blocks and algorithmic state machines; C programming with a focus on microcontroller applications; basic microcontroller
usage, including an introduction to computer architecture, general purpose input/outputs, analogue to digital convertors and basic
timers.

## EEE3096S

This course integrates aspects of embedded systems and computer architecture. This course builds upon the Embedded
Systems 1 (ES1) second year course, which provided fundamental knowledge of electronics, computer architecture and
embedded system design. The course is divided into two parts. 

### Part I

involves computer architecture, operating systems,
and using a single board computer embedded platform and an embedded Linux operating system in case studies and in
practicals. A miniproject (Project A) is performed which involves implementing a state machine and performing
thorough analysis of its design and performance. 

### Part 2

concerns digital system design, focusing on HDL coding and
applying these skills in lab practicals to simulation state machines and other constructs that are useful in embedded
system design.
